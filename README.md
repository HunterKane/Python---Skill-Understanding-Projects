This project was created to develop my skills and understanding of many important visualizations and Machne Learning skills used by Data Scientists. I will completes sections of code to demonstrate it. 

1)  Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
2)  Use plotly for interactive visualizations
3)  Machine Learning with SciKit Learn, including:
4)  Linear Regression
5)  K Nearest Neighbors
6)  K Means Clustering
7)  Decision Trees
8)  Random Forests
9)  Natural Language Processing
10) Neural Nets and Deep Learning
11) Support Vector Machines
